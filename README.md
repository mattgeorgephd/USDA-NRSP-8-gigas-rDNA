## Progress
1. 20220728 - 4 Pacific Oyster families were generated by Pacific Hybreed and transfered to the Jamestown Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery. Diploids and triploids were produced for each family using tetraploid crosses of parents. 
2. 20221114 - Whole body oyster tissue samples collected. n=15 per family per ploidy.
3. 20220117 - Grace Leuchtenberger wrote up the DNA extraction protocol.
4. 20230126 - Henry Berg has expressed interest in helping with the DNA extraction.
5. 20230202 - Ran first round of DNA extraction

## Notes
sampling suggestions
N=15, mention
4 dips, 4 trips â€“ whole genome sequencing 
2-families (8 per family, 4 from each ploidy)
